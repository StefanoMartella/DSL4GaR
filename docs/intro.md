# Introduction

Let's find out the main functionalities of DSL4GaR (Domain Specific Language for Gamification Rules).

## Features

The DSL4GaR is implemented to ease the entire rules design process and to better analyze the rules and their correlation.

### Rules Definition 👨‍💻
The DSL4GaR exposes APIs to define the rules leveraging on the [Fluent Interface pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface); in this way the game designers can focus on the domain's elements rather than the code.

### Rules Simulation 🧪
The DSL4GaR also permits to test the rules to verify their correctness and to deep understand their correlation.<br /> This is possible thanks to a graph that is generated during the simulation that clearly shows the order and the impact of each rule on the state of the game.

### Rules Deployment 🚀
The defined rules can be directly deployed on the gamification engine that takes care of their execution.<br /> The whole process takes place inside the same environment for the designers.
